## 2. Lectures and homework <a name="homework"></a>
The student has to read the following blogs:
- [7 secrets...](https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/7-secrets-to-staying-motivated-when-learning-to-code-a2dy7hqar) 
- [To motivate myself...](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-to-motivate-myself-for-programming-regularly-for-4-6-hours)

Now you can discuss with your classmates :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

Ask to Salvador, Alfonso, Miguel, Diana and GCCyC about the course, philosophy, ideas, projects or any.


Hi guys! In this part all of you will find the first homework. 

To start you have to read the next papers:
- Read the abstract and Introduction of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1719.pdf) (Identifying change patterns in software history)
- Read [The golden age of software architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605176/)
- Read the parts 1 and 2 of the [The History of Software Architecture - In the Eye of the Practitioner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04055.pdf)

Now you have to write a report (nice document!) about the importance and the impact of the software in the actual world. 
<!---
Print and bring the document next August 15th (wednesday) to discuss in the class. :+1:
